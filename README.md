Notes For Programmers
---------------------

Since most of us come from a programming background, I would like to share some
of the things I've found from the perspective of a software developer:

* Do things in parallel when you can. Identify what tasks can be done in
  parallel, and what tasks need to wait for others. If it helps, draw out a
  dependency graph.
* While programming requires everything to be done exactly correctly in order
  to work, this is not the case with cooking. As long as food safety protocols
  are being followed, there is no "wrong" way to cook - it's all up to the
  personal tastes of the chef. Don't be afraid to add, remove, or substitute
  ingredients, or change some of the steps to get a better result.
