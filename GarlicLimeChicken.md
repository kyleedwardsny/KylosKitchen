Garlic Lime Chicken
===================

Original recipe can be found
[here](https://thestayathomechef.com/easy-garlic-lime-skillet-chicken/).

Modifications
-------------

* I use 3 boneless chicken breasts, halved, rather than 6 chicken thighs.
* You may need more olive oil. I usually use 1&#189; to 2 tbsp.
* Put the spice blend in the saucepan with the olive oil and butter instead of
  putting it on top of the chicken. Spread it around in the oil and then put
  the chicken in it. This helps spread the spices more evenly on the chicken.
* Add a side dish of couscous. I usually try to get one with a Mediterranean
  spice blend.
  - **TODO:** Develop a custom spice blend and use it on plain couscous.

Reheating Instructions
----------------------

Put chicken and couscous on a plate. Microwave for 2 minutes.
