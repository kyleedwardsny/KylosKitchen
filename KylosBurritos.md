Kylo's Burritos
===============

This is a custom burrito recipe that I developed from scratch. I wanted
something similar to what I usually order at Chipotle. Frustrated with a lack
of recipes that match what I wanted, I decided to create my own.

I'm not much of a salsa person, but feel free to add your favorite salsa
recipe, or any other ingredients you want.

Ingredients
-----------

* 8 flour burrito tortillas
* 3 boneless chicken breasts
* 32 oz black beans, canned
* 2 cups brown rice, bagged
* 4 jalape&#241;os, diced, with seeds
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp lime juice
* 1 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1 tsp salt
* Taco cheese blend
* Sour cream
* Shredded lettuce
* **TODO**: Spice blend for chicken

Directions
----------

1. Thoroughly drain the black beans. Put in a pot, fill with water to the
   top of the beans. Bring to a low simmer until about &#8532; of the water
   is gone.
2. Pour 8 cups of water into a pot. Add &#189; tsp salt. Bring to a boil, add
   the bags of rice, and boil uncovered for 10-12 minutes. Drain the pot, cut
   open the bags, and dump the rice out of the bags into the pot. Stir in the
   cilantro and lime juice.
3. Half the three boneless chicken breasts lengthwise. Then slice them again,
   lengthwise, into strips &#189;" wide.
4. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the chicken spice blend, and spread it
   around. Add the chicken. Cook until the chicken is cooked all the way
   through. Occasionally turn over the chicken to cook it evenly and to evenly
   spread the spice blend.

5. Remove the chicken from the heat. Cut the strips into small pieces &#189;"
   long.
6. Put a tortilla on a plate. Add rice. Add beans. Add chicken. Add cheese
   blend, jalape&#241;o dice, shredded lettuce, and sour cream. Roll into a
   burrito.
