Chicken Parmesan
================

Original recipe can be found
[here](https://www.skinnytaste.com/baked-chicken-parmesan/).

Modifications
-------------

Melt 8 tbsp butter in a saucepan. Dip each piece of chicken in the melted
butter, top and bottom. Dip the soaked chicken in the breadcrumb mixture. Dip
the chicken in the butter again, and in the breadcrumb mixture again, for
double-breading. This helps the breading stay on better.

Reheating Instructions
----------------------

Put chicken on a plate. Microwave for 2 minutes.
